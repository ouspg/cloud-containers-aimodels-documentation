### Visual Studio Code Container Tools and Kubernetes extensions

The extensions for Docker and Kubernetes in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) make building and debugging complex container setups more straightforward. 

The Container Tools extension provides an easy way to view, manage, and interact with containers, volumes, and images right from your editor, and only take a few clicks to install. The Kubernetes extension allows easy management of clusters and deployments directly from VS Code. 

With both extensions installed, you can build, deploy, and debug containerized applications on Kubernetes clusters without leaving your editor.
